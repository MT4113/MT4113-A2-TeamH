## Task 1: Data exploration

- Create two plots of the data: one with age on the x-axis and length on the y-axis, and one with length on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis.  Add axis labels and any additional information you think is relevant (e.g., average length-at-age). Include your figure in your README file like this: 

![Fig1](https://github.com/MT4113/2018/blob/master/Assignments/A2/StarterRepo/Figures/Figure1.png)

- Comment on the data and plots.  Describe the properties of the data (max 250 words).


## Task 2: Methods description

- In your own words, describe how you will apply the EM algorithm to this dataset (max 250 words).

- Include a diagram of your team's approach to the problem.  This can be digital or hand-drawn and scanned in as a PDF. Again, include your diagram in the README file:

## Task 3: Algorithm implementation

- Create modular code consisting of a set of documented and tested functions implementing this algorithm. Include links to these functions in the README file:

- [Code for implementing the EM algorithm](https://github.com/MT4113/2018/blob/master/Assignments/A2/StarterRepo/Scripts/teamEM.R)

- [Maybe you also have subroutine functions to e.g., calculate the likelihood](https://github.com/MT4113/2018/blob/master/Assignments/A2/StarterRepo/Scripts/calcLikelihood.R)

## Task 4: Function testing

- Write a function to create simulated datasets with similar properties to the "true" data.  Include a link to this function in the README file.

- Show that the algorithm returns correct values for simulated datasets.  How you do this is up to your team.

## Task 5: Results reporting

- Include a table of the estimates returned by `teamEM()` 

| Parameter | mu | sigma | lambda |
|-----------|----|-------|--------|
| Age 1     | #  | #     | #      |
| Age 2     | #  | #     | #      |
| Age 3     | #  | #     | #      |

- Plot the original data with the densities of the mixture components superimposed.  Include your figure in the README file.

## Task 6: Work attribution

- Statement of original work

- In one sentence per team member, describe who did what (e.g., A wrote function x, tested function y, documented function z).
